# landr

source code = website!

> Build a website for your software projects with one command.

## How it works

When you run landr on your local repository, it gathers info by leveraging standard conventions.
It'll first look for a git remote from `github.com` and retrieve some basic information about your project from the github api (`contribution stats`, `releases`), it will then parse standard files like `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` & `/docs`, it'll then use the data to build out beautiful pages for your website.

This allows the maintenance of your website to be a side effect of keeping your software project inline with standard github conventions.

## Quick start guide

Install:
```
npm i -g landr
```

From the root of your local `.git` repo run:
```
landr
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

Build site:
```
landr build
```

View built site locally:
```
landr serve
```

Deploy to github pages:
```
landr deploy
```

## Why landr

You have to maintain your source code while maintain a website too?

As a software company we have a growing number of websites to build and maintain. We built landr so we could focus on our projects and not their websites.

Most OS websites the same, the have a hero, a getting started and some docs. There is definitely room for automation.
