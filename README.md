Generate great websites for your projects with zero configuration.

**Landr is alpha software** and its under heavy development, so various things
might be broken in the best case!

Highlights
----------

- **Functional Websites**: MY test PR Landr renders your project and its documentation in
  a gorgeous and UX friendly way to your end users, in the best possible way
  while you focus on shipping features
- **Follows OSS Conventions**: Landr understands most common repository
  conventions, and makes use of them fully. Build a great repository and get a
  great website for it. Its a win-win
- **Fully Automatic**: Landr requires no configuration at all. It is smart
  enough to figure out what it needs on its own. Point it to a repository, hold
  tight, and let Landr do its magic

Installation
------------

1. Install the Landr CLI:

    ```
    npm install --global landr
    ```

2. Go to a Balena CI powered repo:

    ```
    cd path/to/repository
    ```

3. Generate your website:

    ```
    landr
    ```

Motivation
----------

Creating a website for a project is hard and time-consuming. Yet, a great
website is one of the best ways to promote a project. Landr aims to capture our
experience presenting a wide variety of open source projects on the web, so
that having a website that can compete with your favourite massively popular
open source project is not only possible, but comes with zero overhead.

Examples
--------

The Landr website is of course based on Landr! You may also enjoy the following
sites:

- [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) - Flash OS images to SD cards & USB drives,
  safely and easily
- [BalenaFin](https://www.balena.io/fin/) - A board for fleet owners
- [BalenaOS](https://www.balena.io/os/) - A host OS tailored for containers, designed for
  reliability, proven in production
- [OpenBalena](https://www.balena.io/open/) - Open source software to manage connected IoT
  devices
- [BalenaEngine](https://www.balena.io/engine/) - A container engine built for IoT
